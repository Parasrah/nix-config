I will be using this document to keep track of tricks I discover while using nix.

== Packaging Binaries

A good example of this case is Wonderdraft & Dungeondraft. They are distributed
either via debian files or a zipped file containing the binary and desktop files.

== How to find what package contains a library?

`nix-index && nix-locate <library>`

example:

`nix-index && nix-locate libmonosgen`
